## Overview
The Medical Chatbot leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate and helpful medical insights. It can assist with symptom checking, preliminary diagnosis suggestions, and general health-related inquiries. This chatbot does not replace professional medical advice but serves as a supplementary tool for users.

Key Features:

- Uses mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 for generating responses.

- NLP-powered chatbot with real-time medical query handling.

- cure and privacy-focused.

- loyed as a web application for accessibility.
---

## Motivation


The need for an AI-powered medical chatbot arises from the increasing demand for instant healthcare guidance. Many users require quick, preliminary medical information before consulting a professional. This chatbot provides general healthcare advice while emphasizing the importance of consulting licensed medical practitioners for critical concerns.

## Technical Aspect

1️⃣ Model & AI Framework

- Llama 2 (Meta-Llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) – Core LLM for medical responses
 - LangChain – Efficient LLM integration and chaining

2️⃣ Retrieval & Storage
- Pinecone – Vector database for storing and retrieving medical knowledge
- FAISS (Alternative) – For local vector search

 3️⃣ Backend & Web Framework
- Flask – Web API for chatbot
- FastAPI (Planned) – High-performance alternative

4️⃣ Frontend
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript – Basic UI
- Streamlit (Planned) – Interactive UI for real-time chat

5️⃣ Deployment
- Render / Hugging Face Spaces / AWS (TBD)
